# GitHub Practice for IT 227 Students
IT 227 students' respository for practicing doing pull requests. Introduce yourself via a FIRSTNAME_INITIALS+LASTNAME.md file under the appropriate [`_data/SCHOOL_YEAR/`](_data/) directory, and submit via pull request. See [the example file](_data/1516/mjsolidarios.md), and replace its contents with your own **emoji** (see [this list](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)), **about_me** and **hugot_lines/other_stuffs**.
